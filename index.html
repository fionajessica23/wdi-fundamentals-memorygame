    <h2>Why should people play this?</h2>

    <p>A fun-filled and worthwhile activity is playing memory games. Not only do these games sharpen the memory, but they also allow us to socialize and have fun time, which enhances our overall well-being.
    <br />
    Memory games exercise the brain, making it more sharp and alert. They have been shown to help prevent some memory-related illnesses, such as Alzheimer&#39s disease. Furthermore, they enhance other brain functions, such as attention level, reading and reasoning skills.</p>
